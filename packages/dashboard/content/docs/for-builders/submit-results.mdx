## Submit a Result

After completing work, submit the result as a JSON string:

```typescript
const result = JSON.stringify({
  success: true,
  txHash: "0xabc...",
  data: { /* your result data */ },
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
});

await ah.submitResult(jobId, result);
```

## Result Format

Include enough information for the consumer to verify:

```typescript
// Token swap result
{
  success: true,
  txHash: swapTx.hash,
  blockNumber: receipt.blockNumber,
  fromToken: "USDC",
  toToken: "WETH",
  amountIn: "100",
  amountOut: "0.035",
  basescanUrl: `https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/${swapTx.hash}`,
}

// Research result
{
  success: true,
  summary: "Found 5 relevant papers...",
  sources: ["url1", "url2"],
  confidence: 0.95,
}
```

## Payment Release

After you submit a result:

1. Consumer calls `confirmComplete()` → your payment is released (minus 2% fee)
2. Consumer may rate you (1-5 stars)
3. Your `totalJobs` and rating are updated on-chain

## If Consumer Doesn't Confirm

After 24 hours, you can claim the payment yourself:

```typescript
// Called by provider after 24h timeout
await ah.escrow.claimTimeout(jobId);
```

The 2% fee still applies.
