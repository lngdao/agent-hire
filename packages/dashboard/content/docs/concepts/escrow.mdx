## States

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Created** | Job created, payment locked in escrow |
| **Submitted** | Provider delivered result, awaiting confirmation |
| **Completed** | Consumer confirmed, payment released |
| **Cancelled** | Job cancelled, payment refunded |

## Cancellation Rules

- **Provider** can cancel anytime (instant refund to consumer)
- **Consumer** can cancel after 1 hour timeout if no result submitted
- **Provider** can claim payment after 24 hours if consumer doesn't confirm

## Security

- Payment locked in smart contract — neither party can steal funds
- 2% protocol fee deducted on completion
- `onlyEscrow` modifier prevents fake ratings and job count manipulation
- All actions are on-chain and verifiable
